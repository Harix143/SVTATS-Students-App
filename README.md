# SVTATS-Students-App
Student App of Student Van Tracking and Transportation System.

To solve problems related to school van transportation, we will develop two android applications
for parents/students and drivers along with a web-based application for the admin to view and
manage the services.
School transportation provider will be provided an account through which they can manage their
business. They will be able to manage drivers, students, vans, maintenance, fuel, and mileage
record easily. With the proposed automated system, registering new drivers and students, assigning
vans and drivers, managing fuel and mileage record will be just one click away. They can track
and monitor the live location of any driver at any moment during working hours. System will also
generate profit & loss reports so that service providers can check the overall progress of their
business.
Student can register themselves on our system. A van will be assigned to them. When a student
boards the van, driver will mark his/her attendance. They can also track the real time location of
the van. Students will also be able to mark themselves on leave and change the schedule in no
time.
A van can be assigned to as many students as its sitting capacity thus the students on a van will
not exceed its sitting capacity to ensure safe and comfortable journey
